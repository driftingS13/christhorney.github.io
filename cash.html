            <p class="cash-p">-Basil, the Black and white Boy, is a big sweetheart, His so gentle taking food from you and he loves kids, his been a great dog, I got him when he was around 6 years old already, his half pure Bull Arab and half wild Broome Dog as his dad was rescued from Broome in Western Australia, His always been a bit of a wanderer following his nose whenever he gets the chance. But now as his gotten very old, his slowed down a lot and sleeps a lot more, and gotten even sweeter, Full of chractor and personality, always making me laugh with his antics, and his boof headed kisses are just too funny. 
                
            <p class="cash-p">-Cash, the mostly white Cutie, was a great Dog, he was so sweet, gentle and kind. Unless you had food in your hand then Lookout! unfortunatly during covid lockdowns 2021, I lost him to a long battle with hypo-thyroid diesease. Me and cash had been through a lot together, moving around, living in less than idea situations. We travelled from Melbourne, to adelade, then north through alice springs to Katherine NT, then west to Derby and Broome, then I drove the coast the entire way back south through perth then out east back to melbourne along the southern coast, never once did I need to worry about tieing Cash up or him running away or anything, he was so loyal and loving, I will never forget that trip that just Cash and I took so many great memories, he truly was one of a kind, irriplacable part of my heart. RIP my little dude.</p>
