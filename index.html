                        <p class="home-p">
                            I have always had a love for Cars, Dirt Bikes, Animals (Espesually Dogs) and tech. I started my coding journey on the 23rd of March 2023. In September 2022 I had a motorcycle accident and I can no longer work in my profession as a floor and wall tiler. Over the years I worked my own business for a total of about 5 years, and many years of working for other people in many different areas of construction. Im looking foward to a future where I can make a career and progress my programming skills and knowledge, and become a great full stack developer with well rounded abilities, and the ability to adapt to any challange. As I progress I will add my projects to the projects page, and I will probably add or change this site here and there over time, but I would like some of the pages to stay original to my original design and talant at the time. This site was 100% built by me using HTML and CSS with no framework or any templates. There are still a lot of things I have learned that I havent applied to this site, but I will try to incorperate most of what I learn into most of my projects over time.
